# Declare and Link Phases Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
1. **Separate Phase Coupling**: Declare and link phases tightly coupled but in separate files
2. **Manual ID Management**: Hand-rolled ID generation and tracking
3. **Inconsistent Registration**: Some items registered in declare, others in link
4. **Missing Validation**: No validation of symbol consistency between phases
5. **Error Recovery Gaps**: Limited error recovery in symbol registration
6. **Scope Management**: Basic scope handling without proper nesting

### Strengths to Preserve
- Clear separation between declaration and linking concerns
- Proper forward reference handling
- Good integration with symbol table
- Visitor-based traversal approach

## Improvement Plan (Implementation Order)

### Phase 1: Unified Symbol Registration
**Objective**: Consolidate symbol registration logic

**Changes**:
- Create `SymbolRegistrar` trait with unified interface
- Implement registration strategies for different symbol types
- Add validation during registration
- Create registration transaction system for rollback

**Benefits**:
- Consistent symbol registration across phases
- Better error handling and recovery
- Easier to add new symbol types
- Atomic registration operations

### Phase 2: Scope Management Enhancement
**Objective**: Implement proper lexical scoping

**Changes**:
- Create `ScopeManager` with stack-based scope tracking
- Implement scope creation/destruction hooks
- Add scope-aware symbol lookup
- Support nested scope validation

**Benefits**:
- Proper lexical scoping semantics
- Better error messages for scope violations
- Foundation for closure analysis
- Cleaner symbol resolution

### Phase 3: ID Generation Abstraction
**Objective**: Centralize and optimize ID generation

**Changes**:
- Create `IdAllocator` trait with different allocation strategies
- Implement sequential, random, and typed ID allocators
- Add ID validation and debugging support
- Support ID reservation for forward references

**Benefits**:
- Consistent ID allocation across compiler
- Better debugging with meaningful IDs
- Type safety for different ID types
- Optimized allocation strategies

### Phase 4: Declaration Validation Framework
**Objective**: Add comprehensive validation for declarations

**Changes**:
- Create `DeclarationValidator` with validation rules
- Implement validators for:
  - Duplicate symbol detection
  - Type consistency checking
  - Visibility rule enforcement
- Add validation result aggregation

**Benefits**:
- Early detection of declaration errors
- Better error messages with context
- Consistent validation across symbol types
- Foundation for advanced language features

### Phase 5: Link Resolution Optimization
**Objective**: Optimize link resolution performance

**Changes**:
- Implement link resolution caching
- Add batch resolution for related symbols
- Create resolution dependency tracking
- Support incremental re-resolution

**Benefits**:
- Significant performance improvements
- Reduced redundant resolution work
- Better memory usage patterns
- Support for incremental compilation

### Phase 6: Error Context Enhancement
**Objective**: Improve error reporting for declaration and linking

**Changes**:
- Add source location tracking to all symbols
- Implement error context accumulation
- Create detailed error messages with suggestions
- Add error recovery strategies

**Benefits**:
- Much better user experience
- Easier debugging of symbol issues
- More helpful IDE integration
- Robust error handling

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain existing symbol table integration
- Each phase should improve either performance or correctness
- Consider memory usage of additional tracking structures
- Preserve deterministic symbol resolution
- Add comprehensive tests for each improvement

## Non-Changes (Explicitly Avoided)

- **Dynamic symbol loading**: Not needed for static compilation
- **Complex module systems**: Current approach is sufficient
- **Reflection capabilities**: Would violate language principles
- **Runtime symbol resolution**: All resolution should be compile-time
