# Resolution Improvement Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
1. **Error Propagation Complexity**: Nested `Result` types with complex error conversion
2. **Manual Type Stripping**: Hand-rolled stub type resolution with potential infinite loops
3. **Inconsistent Caching**: Some resolutions cached, others recomputed
4. **Limited Error Context**: Generic resolution failures without specific reasons
5. **Tight Coupling**: Resolution logic tightly coupled to symbol table structure
6. **Missing Validation**: No validation of resolved types for correctness

### Strengths to Preserve
- Clear separation between base resolution and type environment resolution
- Proper handling of stub types and type aliases
- Good abstraction for different resolution contexts
- Recursive resolution with cycle detection

## Improvement Plan (Implementation Order)

### Phase 1: Error Handling Unification
**Objective**: Simplify error handling with unified error types

**Changes**:
- Create unified `ResolutionError` enum covering all failure modes
- Implement `From` conversions for automatic error propagation
- Add error context with source locations and resolution paths
- Create error recovery strategies for common failures

**Benefits**:
- Simpler error handling code
- Better error messages with context
- Consistent error reporting across resolution

### Phase 2: Resolution Cache System
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive caching for expensive resolutions

**Changes**:
- Create `ResolutionCache` with type-safe keys
- Implement cache invalidation strategies
- Add cache statistics and monitoring
- Support partial resolution caching

**Benefits**:
- Significant performance improvements
- Reduced redundant computation
- Better memory usage patterns
- Debugging assistance through cache statistics

### Phase 3: Type Validation Framework
**Objective**: Add validation for resolved types

**Changes**:
- Create `TypeValidator` trait with validation rules
- Implement validators for:
  - Cycle detection in type definitions
  - Arity checking for generic types
  - Constraint satisfaction
- Add validation result reporting

**Benefits**:
- Early detection of invalid type constructions
- Better error messages for type errors
- Foundation for more complex type features

### Phase 4: Resolution Strategy Pattern
**Objective**: Make resolution strategies pluggable and testable

**Changes**:
- Create `ResolutionStrategy` trait for different resolution approaches
- Implement strategies for:
  - Eager resolution (resolve everything immediately)
  - Lazy resolution (resolve on demand)
  - Incremental resolution (resolve only changed parts)
- Add strategy selection based on context

**Benefits**:
- Flexible resolution behavior
- Better performance tuning options
- Easier testing of resolution logic
- Support for different compilation modes

### Phase 5: Dependency Tracking
**Objective**: Track dependencies between resolved types

**Changes**:
- Create `DependencyGraph` for type dependencies
- Implement topological sorting for resolution order
- Add dependency change detection
- Support incremental re-resolution

**Benefits**:
- Correct resolution order for interdependent types
- Efficient incremental compilation
- Better understanding of type relationships
- Cycle detection in type dependencies

### Phase 6: Resolution Debugging
**Objective**: Add comprehensive debugging support

**Changes**:
- Implement resolution tracing with detailed logs
- Add resolution step visualization
- Create resolution testing framework
- Add performance profiling for resolution steps

**Benefits**:
- Easier debugging of complex resolution issues
- Better understanding of resolution performance
- Simplified testing of resolution logic
- Development productivity improvements

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain existing resolution semantics during refactoring
- Each phase should improve either performance or correctness
- Consider memory usage of caching and tracking structures
- Preserve deterministic resolution behavior
- Add comprehensive tests for each improvement

## Non-Changes (Explicitly Avoided)

- **Lazy evaluation everywhere**: Would complicate error reporting
- **Complex dependency injection**: Simple strategy pattern is sufficient
- **Persistent caching**: In-memory caching is adequate for single compilation
- **Automatic resolution ordering**: Explicit dependency tracking is clearer
